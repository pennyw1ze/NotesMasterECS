# IOT security

What is IOT?

> **IOT** **Definition**:
> Cyberphisical ecosystem of interconnected sensors and actuators which enable intelligent decision making;

#### Sensors
Monitor the environment. Sensors can measure physical, chemical and other indicators, and collect informations.

#### Actuators
Robotic arms, drone's rotator ecc. Actuators are the acting part in the IOT environment, and usually requires low computational power.

The structure of an IOT Device is usually the following:
- There is a processing unit:
- The processing unit is conencted to a:
  - Network interface;
  - Non-volatile memory;
  - Power supply;
- The system in his integrity is connected to:
  - Sensors;
  - Actuators;
  - Device management;

The number of IOT devices is continuously increasing and has currently become larger then the number of humans on the planet.
There are several problems in the security of IOT devices. Some of them are:
- moving from private to public networks;
- Low security from early design;
- Difficulty in updating old systems;
