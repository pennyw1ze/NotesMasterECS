The functionalities of a Wallet can be grouped into the following categories:

1. **Secure identification and authentication**, ensuring that Users can present person identification data in a trusted environment.
2. **Exchanging qualified and non-qualified User attributes** through secure and verifiable electronic attestations of attributes.
3. **Electronic signing of documents or data**, allowing Users to create legally recognised qualified electronic signatures and seals.
4. **Generate and use pseudonyms** for authentication, to enhance privacy and prevent tracking.
