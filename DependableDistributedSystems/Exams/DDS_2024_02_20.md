Blockchain is a distributed ledger system that employs consensus mechanisms like PoW to ensure trust and security without central authority. The distinction between public, private, permissioned, and permissionless blockchains lies in their accessibility and control mechanisms. PoW, while ensuring security and decentralization, occasionally results in branching due to simultaneous block generation. These branches are resolved through the longest chain rule, maintaining the integrity and consistency of the blockchain.
