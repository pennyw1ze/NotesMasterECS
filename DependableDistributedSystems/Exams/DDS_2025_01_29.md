# 1

The leader election primitive consists in a choice between processes to elect a process among them  as a leader. The leader election mechanism has the following properties:
1. Eventual election: either there is an election or all processes are faulty;
2. accuracy: if a process is elected as a leader, then all previous leaders have crashed;
The implementation is based upon a PFD and pp2p links, and consists in choosing the leader with a deterministic algorithm between the correct processes, and when the leader crash, execute the algorithm and choose another leader.
The system in perfect leader election is synchronous, with a partial synchronous can be obtained a similar result thanks to Eventual PFD.
