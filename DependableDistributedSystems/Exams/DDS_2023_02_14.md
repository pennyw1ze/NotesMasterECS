> Regular consensus and performance

The consensus mechanism is a primitive that aims to lead a set of process to a common decision. The mechanism is the following: all process in the set makes a proposal, and then they decide a value with a deterministic algorithm. The specification of a regular consensus instance are the following:
- **Termination:** every correct process eventually decides a value;
- **Validity:** a value decided by a process has been previously proposed by a process;
- **Integrity:** no process decides twice;
- **Agreement:** each 2 correct processes decides the same value;
The implementation of the regular consensus is based on a previous series of broadcast of each process to declare their proposal ( $N^2$ messages ), and to decide a value which consists in another broadcast of $N^2$ messages.
