> **Specification of PFD, implementation in synchronous systems and fairloss-link case.**

A Failure detector is an oracle that sends a crash message when a process stops to work properly or stops responding.
A perfect failure detector has the following properties:
- Strong accuracy: correct process are never suspected;
- Strong completeness: eventually every correct process will suspect a process that crashed in the past;
We can implement a perfect failure detector in a synchronous system by just sending hearthbeat messages to each process within continuously to monitor his activity status. If a process does not answare to the hearthbeat request from PFD, is considered as crashed and a crash message is sent to the upper layer. PFD uses pp2p links.
If we use fairloss links instead of perfect p2p links, there is no upper bound to the time that a process could take to answare to the heartbeat, so instead of saying that a process is crashed, we keep a list of suspected process and when a process does not answare to our heartbeat request we will add it to the suspected list.
