# Ex 3

1) (UA,WUTO): Uniform Agreement: Set of delivered by faulty included in set of delivered by correct. All correct deliver same set. WUTO: if 2 process delivers the same messages m and m', they delivers in the same order.
2) p3 delivers m2 between m3 and m4. We do not respect the WUTO property, but only on faulty.
3) p2 and p3 add m2 in right position, then we add m5 deliver to end of a faulty.

# Ex 4

- **Validity**: F, byzantine could send a message pretending to be p, and p's messages is not delivered;
- **No duplication**: NO
- **No creation**: NO
- **Agreement**: YES, due to the fact that is guaranteed by RB which can't be touched by byzantine;
- **FIFO delivery**: YES, as Agreement.
