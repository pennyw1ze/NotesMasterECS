A regular register is a register that holds the 2 following properties:
- **Termination:** An operation performed by a correct process eventually terminates;
- **Validity:** The value returned by a read operation can be the value stored in the register of, if the read is concurrent with the write, also the previous one;
Operations are read and write. Can be also atomic.
