# Ex 1

The leader election problem in distributed systems environment consists in the univoque decision by all the process of a leader, picked from the process themself.
A leader is usually a process with special powers.
An oracle can be implemented throught pp2p links, allowing comunications between processes in order to enable a voting mechanism for the election. To elect a leader, upon a proposal, it is necessary to reach the quorum (majority). Once a quorum is reached, the leader is elected. That's how the oracle works. When a correct process elects a leader, then all the other process chooses the same leader. In eventually synchronous systems we don't know if a process will return a value within a certain bound of time, so we might be waiting too much and the election process could never end.

Data:
- n processes;
- Unique identifier;
- Binary tree;
- Edges = pp2p links;
- Each process has links to FATHER, R_CHILD, L_CHILD;

## **a)**

> Implement a primitive for total order broadcast assuming no process fails.

upon event <Init()>:
	father;
	 lson;
	 rson;
	 ACK = 0
	 waiting = false
	 queue = [0]

upon event <Broadcast,m>:
	trigger <pp2plink_send,(BR_REDIR,self,m,father)>

upon event <pp2plink_deliver,(BR_REDIR,s,m,self)>:
	# We are in redirecting phase till the boss
	if father != NULL:
		 trigger <pp2plink_send,(BR_REDIR,s,m,father)>
	# We are the boss, we add message in queue:
	else:
		queue.enqueue(s,m);

upon event queue != empty and waiting == false:
	waiting = true;
	m = queue.dequeue()
	trigger <Broadcast_deliver(s,m)>
	trigger <pp2plink_send,(BR_DEL,s,m,lson)>
	trigger <pp2plink_send,(BR_DEL,s,m,rson)>

upon event <pp2plink_deliver,(BR_DEL,s,m,self)>:
	trigger <Broadcast_deliver(s,m)>
	# If we are leaves we sends ack
	if lson and rson = NULL:
		trigger <pp2plink_send,(ACK,s,m,father)>
	# Otherwise continue diffusion
	else:
		trigger <pp2plink_send,(BR_DEL,s,m,lson)>
		trigger <pp2plink_send,(BR_DEL,s,m,rson)>

upon event <pp2plink_deliver,(ACK,s,m,self)>
	ACK += 1;

upon event ACK = 2:
	if father != NULL:
		trigger <pp2plink_send,(ACK,self,m,father)>
	else:
		waiting = false;
	ACK = 0

## **b)**
NO properties are violated in my implementation since the diffusion of the message must pass throught the link of each node to reach every node. My code would just stop working since the leader needs all the acks to continue the delivery of the process. In some case if a broadcast start outside the compromised part of the tree, there might be a few delivers, but then the algorithm will stop working since not all process have delivered.
Validity and agreement are violated, no creation and no duplication are not violated.

## **c)**

When a node of our tree explodes, we can patch with the folloing:
Add the crashed process to a list: Each crashed process creates 2 new more trees that are indipendent. We set the father link to the crashed to null, and each time we broadcast a message we ask the new 2 leaders (son of the crashed if any) to behave as leader and to diffuse the message. If the broadcast starts inside the indipendent tree, when it reaches the leader, he must diffuse the broadcast to his brother and to his granfather wich will start broadcast event in the other independent trees.
