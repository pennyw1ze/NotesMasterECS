m1 -> m3, m3 -> m4, m1 -> m2.

I make all the correct deliver m1, m2, m3, m4

1. It is linearizable, in fact the sequence is valid since the operations are not yet closed when the 1 is removed from the group (get add get get remove get add get is a valid sequence);
2.  Non chiaro

1. We basically have a beb broadcast: sn never used, Validity guaranteed because if a correct process broacast sends the message with a for cycle using pp2p and we have guarantees that it will be received, no creation again for pp2p guarantees, and agreement is not guaranteed since if a process fails, some process could receive a message broadcasted by him while others could not receive it, and correct will not reboradcast it but just deliver it.
2. None of the ordering property is guaranteed, since it could happen that a correct process broadcast 2 messages and the second one arrives later then the first one in a process, and before the first in another process. In this case we loose all ordering property since CAUSAL $\implies$ FIFO, and since TOTAL asks the same delivery order for all the processes.
