(UA,SNUTO) because is uniform. It is not SUTO, it is not WUTO either because faulty exchanges m3 with m2.

**2)** 
FIFO: m1 -> m2
CAUSAL: m2 -> m3
Causal is violated by p2 and p4. FIFO is always respected.

No, because if R4() returns 3, R5() can only return 3

# Ex 3

- **Validity:** The validity of the broadcast is guaranteed by the best effort broadcast;
- **No duplication:** It is guaranteed in the deliver event, since we check if the message received is been already delivered;
- **No creation:** Property given by the best effort broadcast;
- **Agreement:** Satisfied because if the broadcasting process fails and some correct delivers it, it rebroadcast also. If no correct delivers no problem. A correct p will deliver a broadcast of a correct q because of beb validity property.

# Ex 4

> **Implement (1,N) Regular Register algorithm on a binary tree system**

Properties to guarantee:
- **Termination:** Each r/w operation eventually terminates;
- **Validity:** A read operation return the last written value or concurrent write value;

**Implementation onrr:**

upon event Init:
	my_id = get_id();
	value = 0;
	father = get_father();
	lson = get_lson();
	rson = get_rson();

upon event <onrr,(WriteRequest,v)>:
	value = v;
	trigger <onrr,(WriteReturn,value)>;

upon event <pp2p_link_deliver((ReadRequest,s,d),self)>:
	if d = my_id:
		diffuse((ReadReturn,value,self,s))
	else:
		diffuse((ReadRequest,s,d))

upon event <pp2p_link_deliver((ReadReturn,v,s,d),self)>:
	if d = self:
		trigger<onrr,(ReadReturn,v)>
	else:
		diffuse((ReadReturn,v,s,d))

upon event <onrr,(ReadRequest,d)>:
	if d = self:
		trigger<onrr,(ReadReturn,v)>
	else:
		diffuse((ReadRequest,self,d))

// Auxiliar function to diffuse message
// to simplify life, just let the information go through
// all the nodes in the tree, it will reach the destination
// for sure
diffuse(message):
	if father != null:
		trigger pp2p_link_send(message,father)
	if rson != null:
		trigger pp2p_link_send(message,rson)
	if lson != null:
		trigger pp2p_link_send(message,lson)

**2)**
With byzantine failures, I will loose all the RR property. An operation such as a read could not terminate if the byzantine decides not to spread the value over the tree, or could decide to modify the value inside the read return in order to violate validity.
