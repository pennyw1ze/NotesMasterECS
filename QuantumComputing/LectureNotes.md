> **Not solving** NP-complete problems

> Quantum computers and classical computers can **solve** the **same problems** (but with different time complexity)


> **Reversable Turing machine**
   Quantum computers must be reversable (when you do computations, you can always recover previous state). So basically we do not have a one-way computation anymore.
