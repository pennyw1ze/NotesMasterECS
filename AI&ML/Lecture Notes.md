# Introduction

AI is about devising agents (programs or devices) that acts intelligently.
The definition is just blurry because we do not know what intelligence actually is.
How to test if an entity is an artificial intelligence ?
##### Turing test
To state if we are talking about an artificial intelligence, we need to perform a test to state if a machine is acting as a human. I put a wall between a man and an entity. The man does not know if on the other side of the wall there is a human or a machine. Now, if you are not able to tell if the entity on the other side of the wall is a machine or a human, the entity passed the test, and the program is defined as intelligent.

##### Act ractionally
Is the main approach because it also involves all the other approaches. It measures if a machine acts as to achieve the best result (?) #checkathome

## Formal definition
Devising agent that behave so as to maximize an objective function.

### Machine learning
It is an area of AI, which has grown so much that has become separate from AI.

## Inductive vs Deductive AI

**Deductive** start from general rules, facts, requirements, and deduce from knowledge, throught some form of reasoning, including probabilistic reasoning. Basically makes strict logical inference.

**Inductive** approach, starting from collected data, learn input output relationship underlying data, and use learned lwas for your purposes. Basically it means learning from data patterns.

## History

Official birth of AI: '56.
First artificial neurons in the middle of 50s, then, since there was not enaugh computational power, there was a loss of interest in this subjects. The interest has grown again when people started to see results. A huge problem was the data, not digital, and where physically provided and manually digitalized. Thanks to big data, we started to make systems learns very fast.

### Today
Autonomous vehicles, automated translation, legged robots, game playing, medicine, image recognition.
AI can't proove anything, can hardly explain output decisions, can't behave ethically, can't distinguish right, wrong, ecc.

# Agents

Ai is about agents, as we told. So now we need to define agents.
An agents is basically an entity (a  program, a device), that can percept something from an environment, and can perform actions in an environment.
We can also act on ourself as part of the world.
Example: enviroment: chess board, agent: moove pieces, access board states.
An agent can perceive through sensors and act through actuators.
Chess rational agents: rewards for capturing piece (+10), penalty for loosing, high reward for checkmating opponent, 0 for tie, ecc. With this rules, we can ask an agent to optimize this values.
How to design agents to deliberate correct actions?
First of all, we must reason on the nature of the environment. Different environments leads to different approaches.
