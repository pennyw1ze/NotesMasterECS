# Question 1 90 mins (up to 18 points)
The Smart Health & Wellness Management System (SHWMS) is designed to help individuals monitor, manage, and improve their health and well-being. The system integrates data from wearable devices, smart home sensors, and user input, providing personalized
analytics, recommendations, and automations to support a healthy lifestyle. Users can access their information and control settings via a dedicated mobile application and web portal.
User Functions
• Real-time Vital Parameter Monitoring: Users can view their vital parameters (e.g., heart rate, sleep
quality, steps, activity levels) in real-time from compatible wearable devices and sensors.
• Historical Wellness Analysis: Users can access historical health and wellness data, analyze trends
(daily, weekly, monthly), and compare periods to identify patterns.
• Personalized Goal Management: Users can set health and wellness goals (e.g., daily steps, sleep hours,
hydration) and track progress against these objectives.
• Adaptive Wellness Plans: The system provides personalized recommendations for exercise, nutrition,
and stress management based on user data, preferences, and goals.
• Health Reminders and Notifications: Users can configure reminders for medication intake, hydration,
medical appointments, and receive notifications for anomalies in detected data.
• Food and Mood Diary Integration: Users can log food intake, mood, and other wellness-related factors
for holistic analysis.
Administrator Functions (for System Operators/Service Providers)
• Device Integrations Management: Administrators can add, update, or remove supported wearable
device and sensor types, along with their communication protocols.
• System Health Monitoring: Administrators can view the operational status of deployed SHWMS
instances, identify issues (e.g., sensor disconnections, data anomalies), and perform remote
diagnostics.
• User Account Management: Administrators can create, update, or delete user accounts and manage
their subscription plans or access levels to premium services.
• Security and Privacy Protocol Configuration: Administrators can manage global system security
settings and ensure compliance with health data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
• Educational Content Management: Administrators can update and manage the library of educational
content (e.g., articles, guides, recipes) available to users.
System Features
Device Interoperability: Support for various communication protocols (e.g. Bluetooth LE. Wi-Fi, ANT+) to
integrate with a wide range of wearable devices and smart home sensors.
Cloud-based Backend: A scalable cloud infrastructure for health data storage. processing, and analytics.
Mobile Application & Web Portal: Intuitive interfaces for users to interact with the system and view their data.
Health Data Analytics Engine: Advanced algorithms for analyzing health data patterns, detecting anomalies,
and generating personalized insights.
Intelligent Recommendation Engine: A rules-based or Al-driven engine for generating adaptive wellness plans
and personalized reminders.
Notification Service: Sends alerts and reminders via push notifications, email, or SMS (e.g., out-of-range
values, medication reminders).
Security & Privacy: Robust security measures to protect user health data and ensure compliance with privacy
regulations.
API for Third-Party services (e.g., telemedicine providers, gyms, nutritional services).
Given the above requirements for the Smart Health & Wellness Management System
(SHWMS), you are required to:
• Describe the requirements of the SHWMS in detail, providing relevant user stories. Remember, you have
the freedom to elaborate on these requirements, so be clear and precise. User stories should be
documented in a suitable format (e.g., "As a [User Role], I want to [Goal], so that [Benefit]").
• Design the architecture of the SHWMS. This must include: a.
1. A diagram illustrating the main components of the system.
2. Detailed descriptions and specifications for each major component.
3. A proposal for technologies to be adopted for key components (e.g., database, messaging, backend
framework, mobile platform).
4. An explanation of the interfaces and communication mechanisms among components.
•Assuming a total development time of 10 months, organize the software development life cycle using an
Agile methodology (e.g., SCRUM). Document your chosen methodology, including how you would
structure the development into iterations/sprints, how you would manage requirements, risks, and
quality throughout the project lifecycle.
In case of doubts make your own assumptions, describe them, and develop the exercise based on such
assumptions.

SysML is a modeling representative lenguage, used to build softwares, and more generally systems. SysML is very close to UML, in which you use diagrams to represent the software components and their interactions. In SysML there are generic blocks, which might cooperate in some way, and there are specialized blocks which ineherits all the properties of the general one, and can have further properties.
SysML is composed of different type of diagrams:
- **Internal block diagram:** Defines the use of blocks in the composition;
- **Parametrics diagram:** It's used to express constraints between value properties;
- **Behavioural diagram:** Like an activity diagram, represents the transformation of the input into the output.

**CMMI** (Capability Maturing Model Integration) is a process improvement approach.
It can be used as a collection of good practices, or as a framework to prioritize activities.
The components of this framework are organized in constellations. There are 3 constellations:
- Developement process;
- Acquiring process;
- Delivering service;
There are 5 possible achievement of companies, incomplete, performed, managed, defined, quantitatively defined and optimizing. Each process area has 1 to 4 goals.

**ISO12207** is a standard for the software lifecycle process., that deals with software engeneering.  It defines structure and activities involved in the software development process, and uses a common lenguage in order to involve stakeholders.
It is characterized by primary lifecycle processes, support and mantainances processes and organizational processes.
