> **Strong and weak collision resistance

An hashing function $h:D->R$ is defined weak collision resistant if, given $x$, it's hard to find $x' \neq x$ s.t.
$h(x) = h(x')$.
An hashing function $h:D->R$ is strong collision resistant if it's hard to find $x,x',x\neq x'$ s.t. $h(x) \neq h(x')$.

> RSA confidentiality

Usually RSA is used for confidentiality only to exchange keys
