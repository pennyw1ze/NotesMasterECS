## Model, Satisfiability and validity for closed formulas
> An interpretation $I$ is a **model** of a closed formula $\phi$ if $I \models \phi$.
> A closed formula $\phi$ is **satisfiable** if there is some $I$ such that $I \models \phi$.
> A closed formula $\phi$ is **unsatisfiable** if it's not satisfiable.
> A closed formula $\phi$ is **valid** if for every $I$ we have that $I \models \phi$.

> A closed formula $\phi$ is **logically implied** by a set of closed formulas $\Gamma$ if for all interpretation $I$, if $I \models \Gamma$, then $I \models \phi$. 

Checking if a formula in first-order logic is valid is an undecidable problem. We can see that by modeling the halting problem.
