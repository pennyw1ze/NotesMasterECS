## Expansion Rules
$\alpha$-rules -  Deterministic Rules, in conjunction, we don't need to choose any path
- When we use $\alpha$-rule to expand, we may want to expand one of the two at first, but we will need to expand the other too, at one point.

$\beta$-rules - Splitting Rules, done in the disjunctions, we need to non-deterministically choose a path

Logical rules, once again. Too lazy to write them here, please write them in last notes.
The goal of expansion rules is to create a situation in which are symbols are cancelled and/or simplified, so that the formula creates a raw literal.
When we expand a rule we'll need to expand it on the leaves underneath it.
# Tableaux
>A tableaux is a tree-like structure, where root is the original formula $\varphi$.
>we want to check for satisfiability, and internal nodes contain formulas over propositions of $\varphi$. All levels are labelled with X or O.

Once construction is complete, we'll say that _$\varphi$ is satisfiable if and only if there exist some leaf labelled with O_

_in the image above we first expanded $(P \vee Q)$ using the $\beta$ rule, and we got down to literals. When we expanded $\neg(P \wedge Q) = (\neg P \vee \neg Q$) using again the $\beta$ rule on the bottom of the two nodes. _


Tableaux is constructed proceeding top-down with the goal of reducing to literals. 
We start with root labelled with formula to check and at every step one node is expanded (only once).
If a path contains contradictory formulas, then add leaf with X. Once all nodes along a path have been expanded, path to no contradiction terminate with O. Once expanded, we can check for contradictions so that we can see if a given formula is satisfiable or not by checking if there exist at least one leaf O.

If $\Gamma \models \varphi$ if and only if $\Gamma \cup \{\neg \varphi\}$ is un-satisfiable.

If $\Gamma=\{\varphi_1,...,\varphi_m\}$ is finite, this is equivalent to:
$\Gamma \models \varphi$ if and only if $\varphi_1 \wedge ... \wedge \varphi_m \wedge \neg \varphi$ is un-satisfiable
