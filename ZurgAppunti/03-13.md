### Types of formulas
- $t_1 = t_2$
- $P(t_1, ..., t_n)$ where $P/n$ is a predicate symbol over $n$ terms
$t_i$ can be variables or constants.
Any two FOL formulas can be combined by means of *logical connectives* used in propositional logic.

## FOL Interpretation
Is a mathematical entity that grants meaning to the formula. It's a pair $<\Delta,I>$ where
- $\Delta$ is a non-empty set called interpretation domain
- $I$ is a function, called interpretation function, such that:
	- $I(c_i) \in \Delta$ for each constant
	- $I(f_i): \Delta^n \rightarrow \Delta$ for each function symbol $f_i/n$ \[Professor deleted it\]
	- $I(P_i) \subset \Delta^n$ for each predicate symbol $P_i/n$  

Example (unary predicate):
- $P(x):$ Student x owns a bike
- We have an **interpretation domain** $\Delta = \{s_1, ..., S_{120}\}$
- $P^I = I(P) = \{s_{13}, s_{24} \}$ : We have assigned two students to the interpretation of the predicament $P \subset \Delta$.
- Constants $c$ are labels for objects, which will be named in the interpretations
	- ex: $I(c_{13}) = s_{13}$ 
We have now that $I \models P(c_{13})$ . We know this because $I(c_{13}) = s_{13}$ and  $s_{13} \in I(P)$.
# Assignment
An assignment $\alpha$ for $I$ is a function from the set of variables to $\Delta$, which binds a value to every variable $\Delta$.
If $\alpha$ is an assignment for $I$, then $\alpha[x/d]$ denotes the assignment for $I$ that coincides with $\alpha$ on all the variables but $x$, which is associated to $d$ instead. It's used to check satisfaction of a formula with quantifiers.
Given a variable $x$, $\alpha(x)$ returns an object in $\Delta$.

To know if an interpretation is valid, we need an assignment.
### Interpreting a term
$t$ can be a variable or a constant. If $t \in x$ then we check the interpretation $\alpha(t)= \alpha(x) = x^{I,\alpha}$, otherwise check the interpretation $I(c) = c^{I, \alpha}$
