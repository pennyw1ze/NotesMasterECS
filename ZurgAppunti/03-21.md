### Semantic Tableaux
For the tableaux method, we don't  need an interpretation to assume that a formula is valid/sat/not-sat.
Example:
$$
\exists(P(x) \wedge \neg Q(x)) \wedge \forall y(P(y) \vee Q(y))
$$

==Expanding all rules doesn't guarantee that there is no way to close the tableaux!== It depends all from the choices that we do.
### Tableaux Proof for logical consequences
we'll try to see if $\phi \models \psi$ , if and only if there is no interpretation satisfying $\phi$ and not satisfying $\psi$. We'll use the same method used with Propositional Logic => $\phi \wedge \neg \psi$.
## Infinite Domain
Differently from propositional logic, in FOL models can be infinite, and so we have an infinite branch in the Tableaux.
==If the formula has such infinite model we can say it's satisfiable, but we can't prove satisfiability with an interpretation.==
Example: ![[Pasted image 20250321100003.png]]
This has infinite representations, since the first tells us that there isn't any interpretation with R having same object, the third is saying that for every object there is an other object associated to the first through R.
The third has transitivity property, but this means that there isn't a single interpretation that satisfy this, and trying to construct one leads to an infinite model interpretation.
# Termination
In contrast to what happens in propositional logic, the tableaux construction is not guaranteed to terminate.
>If the formula $\phi$ that labels the root is unsatisfiable the construction is guaranteed to terminate and the tableau is closed.
>If the formula $\phi$ that labels the root is satisfiable then either the construction is guaranteed to terminate and the tableau is open, or the construction does not terminate.
# FOL: Evaluation and Reasoning
> A FOL query is an open FOL formula

When $\varphi$ is a FOL query with free variables $(x_1, ..., x_k)$ then we sometimes write it as a $\varphi(x_1,..,x_k)$, and say that $\varphi$ has arity $k$.
Given an interpretation $I$, we are interested in those assignments that map the variables $x_1, ..., x_k$ (and only those). We write an assignment $\alpha$ such that $\alpha(x_i) = a_i$ for $i=1,...,k$ as $<a_1,...,a_k>$.
> Given an interpretation $I$, the _answer to a query $\varphi(x_1,...,x_k)$ is
> $$\varphi(x_1,...,x_k)^I = \{(a_1, ..., a_k) \ |\ I, <a_1, ..., a_k>\ \models \varphi(x_1, ..., x_k)\}$$

We can answer the query under the condition that the interpretation is finite.
